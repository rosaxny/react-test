## Notes
 1. Lifecycle
	 - Pay attention to how many times each function runs
 3. `.bind(this)`
	 - scope
	 - `this`
 4. props
	 - **stateful components**: props are set inside the components
	 - **stateless components**: props are passed as a parameter from one component to another
 5. event listeners
	 - pass a function as a prop from the parent component to a child component
	 - event listener is located in child component
